# Introduction

Basically this website is designed to visualise how the gravitational field is working in our solar system. In this you can add more planets, can define thier trajectory by clicking and dragging it

You can also experience how the planets moves around when the space is polycentric (means there are more than one suns around it) also you can also conclude that from each and every space point if the planet is moving around sun it will not revolve around it. To revolve around it it must have minimum speed and how can you achieve that? You can do it by clicking and dragging your mouse
