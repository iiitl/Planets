# Planet: Gravitational Field Simulator

## Introduction
Welcome to the Planet repository, a simulation of a gravitational field. This project allows users to interact with particles and attracting bodies, exploring the dynamics of a gravitational field. The simulator is designed to be intuitive and educational, providing a visual representation of the principles of physics.

## Features
The following features are available in the Planet simulation:

Creation of particles by clicking on the simulation screen
Creation of attracting bodies by holding down the Shift key and clicking on the simulation screen
Adjustment of particle initial speed and direction by clicking and dragging in empty space
Displacement of attracting bodies by clicking and dragging on them

## Technical Details
The Planet simulation is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizes a physics engine to accurately simulate the dynamics of a gravitational field.

## Getting Started
To start using Planet, simply clone this repository and open the index.html file in your web browser. No additional software or dependencies are required.
